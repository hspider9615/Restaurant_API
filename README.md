# Restaurant_API
The restaurant_api project offers a robust system for restaurant management with models for Categories, Foods, Orders, Restaurants, and Users. It supports user registration, login, password recovery, and account deletion. Users can explore restaurants, view food categories, place orders, and track their order status.
